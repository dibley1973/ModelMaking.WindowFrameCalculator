# ModelMaking.WindowFrameCalculator
This repository is for a web application tool for calculating window pane and frame sizes for model making, scratch building, laser cutting.

## Background
While designing buildings for model making I often struggle to get calculate the sizes for window panes and window frames given a set size window. 

The purpose of this project is to build a small HTML and JavaScipt single page application that will allow the user to enter the following information:

## Requirements

**Given the window information specified below...**

- The width of the window opening
- The height of the window opening
- The number of columns of window panes
- The number of rows of window frames
- The outer frame width
- The inner frame widths

- Initially these dimension will be in mm.

**The application will...**
- Calculate the size of the windows panes
- Calculate the positional offset for the top left hand side of the window.

## Nice to haves

Once the basics are handles there will always be a bunc of nice to haves for the application. 

- Render a representation of the  window using HTML canvas
- Create and SVG file which can be download

## Probability of Completion

Realistically, like all of my other repos, this will probably never get completed. however being a much less audacious porject than all of my others maybe, _just maybe_, this will have a chance of getting across the line.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute if you think this may be useful to you. You can contribute in any of the following ways:

- Suggesting a feature
- Working on a feature 
- Testing a feature
- Raising a bug
- Fixing a bug
- Discussing the application
- Sharing this repo or the finished website (when done) with others

## Branching 

Branching will be a modified git flow, with a main branch

## CI

There will be no CI initially but when we get some kind of working product we may introduce Travis or gitHub Actions to build and deploy
